1. Hand should be reorganized when card is dragged
When card is dragged out of hand area:
	remove_from_hand()
When card is dragged into hand area:
	return_to_hand()

2. DropBox for cards to be played.
If dropped_in_drop_box:
	If card_needs_target and no_valid_target:
		return_to_hand()
	else:
		play_card()
		# no need to remove from hand as it should already have been dragged out
else:
	return_to_hand()

3. More solid selected_card algorithm

4. CardInfoArea
